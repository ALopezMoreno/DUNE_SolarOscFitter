"""
This script defines functions for calculating the Poisson log-likelihood of neutrino event data, using 
Monte Carlo (MC) propagated samples to evaluate expected event rates against observed data. It is part of 
a larger framework for neutrino physics analysis, focusing on elastic scattering (ES) and charged current 
(CC) interactions.

Dependencies:
- Utilizes Julia packages such as `Random`, `LinearAlgebra`, `Statistics`, `Distributions`, `StatsBase`, 
  `BAT`, `DensityInterface`, and `IntervalSets` for statistical and mathematical operations.
- Assumes the existence of organization-specific data structures and modules, including `ereco_data`, 
  `responseMatrices`, `solarModel`, `unoscillatedSample`, and `backgrounds`.

Functions:
- `poissonLogLikelihood`: Computes the Poisson log-likelihood for vectors of expected and measured event 
  counts, handling edge cases where counts are zero to avoid mathematical errors.
- `likelihood_all_samples_avg`: Calculates the total log-likelihood for neutrino events using average 
  propagation of samples, considering ES and CC interactions.
- `likelihood_all_samples_ctr`: Faster than `likelihood_all_samples_avg`, but uses a different propagation 
  method for samples, where the propagation is done only at the bin centers instead of integrating over bins.

Parameters:
- `nExpected`: A vector of expected event counts for each interaction channel.
- `nMeasured`: A vector of measured event counts for each interaction channel.
- `parameters`: Model parameters used in the propagation of samples and likelihood calculations.

Process:
1. Validates input vectors for non-negativity and equal length in `poissonLogLikelihood`.
2. Propagates MC samples through the detector simulation using specified functions (`propagateSamplesAvg` or `propagateSamplesCtr`).
3. Computes expected event rates for different interaction channels and calculates the log-likelihood 
   using the `poissonLogLikelihood` function.
4. Handles energy thresholding by identifying the appropriate indices for analysis based on the energy 
   threshold `Emin`.

Output:
- Returns the total negative log-likelihood for the given parameters, which can be used in optimization 
  routines or further statistical analyses.

Testing:
- Includes a test function `test_log_likelihood_execution_time` to measure the execution time of the 
  `poissonLogLikelihood` function and verify its correctness against expected results.

Note:
- Ensure that all required data structures and constants are defined and accessible in the working 
  environment before executing the script.
- The script assumes that the input data is pre-processed and compatible with the organization's internal 
  formats.
